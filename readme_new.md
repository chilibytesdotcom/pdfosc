PDFOSC is an PDF viewer based on PDF.JS with Open Sound Control (OSC) functionalities.</br>
It allows you to manage PDF presentations in any type of event, thanks to a simplified UI and clever features;</br>
not only provides real-time feedback and control across multiple devices, but addresses the limitation of PDFs: the absence of page and progress tracking.‚Äù

With PDFOSC, you can:</br>
- Control PDF presentations remotely using OSC commands</br>
- Receive real-time updates on current slide and total slides</br>
- Jump to 1st, Last or specific page</br>
- Use the most common shortcuts so you don't have to change your habits</br>
