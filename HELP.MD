A full refactor using Tauri is currently in progress: this will significantly improve performance and reduce application size.

## 🎛️ OSC Remote Control

A Companion module is currently pending approval. Once it’s included in the stable release, you’ll find help available [here](https://github.com/chilibytesdotcom/companion-module-chilibytes-pdfosc).

Control PDFOSC remotely using Open Sound Control (OSC) messages:

### Available Commands
- `/pdfosc/next` - Go to next page
- `/pdfosc/prev` - Go to previous page  
- `/pdfosc/firstpage` - Jump to first page
- `/pdfosc/lastpage` - Jump to last page
- `/pdfosc/presentation` - Enter presentation mode
- `/pdfosc/exitpresentation` - Exit presentation mode

### Real-time Feedback
When in presentation mode, PDFOSC sends OSC feedback:
- `/pdfosc/current [page]` - Current page number
- `/pdfosc/total [pages]` - Total number of pages
- `/pdfosc/state [status]` - Presentation mode status

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Application Issues

**PDFOSC Won't Start**
- Verify system requirements are met
- If it's first run, **wait**.
- Check file permissions in installation directory
- Try running as administrator (Windows) or with appropriate permissions
- Restart your computer and try again

**PDF Files Won't Open**
- Verify the PDF file is not corrupted (try opening in another PDF viewer)
- Check file permissions and ensure you have read access
- Ensure the PDF is not password-protected or encrypted
- Try copying the file to a different location

**Performance Issues**
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- Use optimized PDF files when possible
- Clear application cache through Settings menu

### OSC Connection Problems

**OSC Commands Not Working**
- Verify OSC is configured in Settings
- Check port settings
- Ensure firewall is not blocking OSC ports
- Test with OSC monitor software to verify message sending

- Verify send port settings
- Ensure receiving application is listening on correct port
- Test network connection between devices

**Network Connectivity**
