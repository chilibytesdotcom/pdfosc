</br>
PDFOSC is a PDF viewer based on PDF.JS with Open Sound Control (OSC) functionalities.</br>
It allows you to manage PDF presentations in any kind of event, thanks to a simplified UI and clever features.</br>
As well as allowing remote control across multiple devices, addresses the key limitation of PDF viewers:</br>
the absence of real-time pages, progress tracking and feedback in Presentation Mode.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>

With PDFOSC, you can:</br>
- Control PDF presentations remotely using OSC commands</br>
- Send real-time updates on current slide and total slides</br>
- Jump to 1st, Last or specific page</br>
- Use the most common shortcuts so you don't have to change your habits</br>
